{"name":"Superheroine Justice League","tagline":"Trading cards of female leaders & their superheroine alter egos!","body":"<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/VJMHzYx.png\"/>\r\nAn application developed by Team Spitfire Athlete during #ChimeHack to inspire women around the world and make women leaders more visible.\r\n\r\nWhat if inspiring female leaders had their own trading cards? What if you could learn about their impact, interesting facts, and how they went after their goals? \r\n\r\nIn the Superheroine Justice League app, we take a fun twist and also share these women's powerful superheroine alter egos. \r\n\r\nIn this app, you can make trading cards of women who inspire you, share those cards on Twitter, and spread the word about the changes they are fighting for. \r\n\r\nThis app is about women bringing to light the accomplishments of other women. And why superheroines? Because deep down inside, we are all superheroines waiting to be unleashed.\r\n\r\n![Main View Controller](http://s3.amazonaws.com/challengepost/photos/production/solution_photos/000/070/207/datas/xlarge.png?1386461417)\r\n\r\n![Create A Card](http://s3.amazonaws.com/challengepost/photos/production/solution_photos/000/070/210/datas/xlarge.png?1386461433)\r\n\r\n![Nav View Controller](http://s3.amazonaws.com/challengepost/photos/production/solution_photos/000/070/217/datas/xlarge.png?1386461586)\r\n\r\n![Sample Superheroine](http://s3.amazonaws.com/challengepost/photos/production/solution_photos/000/070/212/datas/xlarge.png?1386461444)\r\n\r\n![Sample Profile](http://s3.amazonaws.com/challengepost/photos/production/solution_photos/000/070/219/datas/xlarge.png?1386461603)\r\n\r\n![Sample Tweet](http://s3.amazonaws.com/challengepost/photos/production/solution_photos/000/070/208/datas/xlarge.png?1386461423)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@nidhik\r\n@neverbendeasy\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
